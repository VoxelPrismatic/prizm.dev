#] WHO AM I?

I am a human [duh] that loves to code really much of anything. I made a discord \
bot [PRIZM] in about a month, while teaching myself _python_ in about the same \
time.

I love making music and creating neat code things just because I find it relaxing. \
My favorite genre is ambient in case you wanted to know that.

#] WHAT LANGUAGES DO I USE/KNOW?

I am currently learning Java, with literally the worst teacher ever. I also know \
a bit of JS, and ofc I use Python. Additionally, I use TI-BASIC, where I made RPN \
for the TI-84+CE. I can learn any language very quickly, however.

I also made my version of MarkDown in JS, so I can make pretty neat looking sites \
such as the one you are seeing here.

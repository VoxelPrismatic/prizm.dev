#] WHO AM I?

I am a human [duh] that loves to code really much of anything. I made a discord
bot [PRIZM] in about a month, while teaching myself _python_ in about the same
time.

#] A BIT MORE ABOUT ME

as a teen, my high school teachers hate me because i am the wierd guy who always
does things the different way. for context, my AP CompSci teacher questions me
when i use firefox instead of safari, or use intellij instead of bluej, or even
why i use linux at home over macos or windows. basically, im truly the odd one
out, but im proud of that!

i like doing anything, if i want to do it, i will do it. for example, see this
text here? well, i made my own flavor of markdown cuz i dont want to stare at
html garbage all the time. in the meantime, i need to make a brand-new website
so i can be proud of what i made

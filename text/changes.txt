>  ALIAS - "paint", "color", "canvas", "painting", "drawing", "coloring"
COLOR  [STR] - The color you want to place, MUST BE HEX
xN, yN [ANY] - The XY coordinates [MAX - 127, MIN - 0]
- - You can use ranges like 0-16
- - You can be relative like ~1
- - You can use relative ranges like ~9-26
*If no params are passed, the image is sent
*If only coordinates are passed, the color at that coordinate is sent along with the image
*ALL relative points are relative to the previously drawn point IN THE SAME MESSAGE
*^ Any starting relative points will be relative to 0, 0

                <br />
                Once upon a time, a boy played hide and go seek with his friends. Because all of his friends were boys, they all agreed that the bathroom was a valid place to go hide. Of course, only an idiot would actually hide in the
                bathroom, so luckily the boy wasn't. Instead, he hid behind the bathroom in the forest or around there. Anyway, as the game went on, it became much more intense, as everybody was trying to find everybody else. Unfortunately,
                the boy had such great luck to have been found, but he was the first one to check the bathroom.<br />
                <br />
                Upon entering the establishment, the boy realized that the stalls were made of brick, and could be short enough to sit on top of. All the others gathered round to eventually conclude that it would be cool to sit up there,
                but overall a stupid idea. This boy thought otherwise, so he proceeded to hop on the toilet, and climb on top of the brick stall. As expected, the stall didn't topple over. Unamazed, the others left as it would be suspicious
                seing like 5 people in the bathroom walking around while one is on top of the stall. <br />
                <br />
                Soon, lunch was called, so the boy hopped down from the stall trying to land on the toilet seat as an intermediate step. A pretty easy "challenge", wouldn't you say? Well, against all logic and common sense, the boy missed
                the top of the toilet and instead his lower leg hit the edge of the toilet pretty hard. Well, just a little bruise, maybe a big one at most, right? Surely the toilet couldn't have done too much damage to him... RIGHT?
                <i><b>NOPE!</b></i> Somehow, the smooth toilet edge created a massive gash in the middle of the boy's leg, and right away he knew that he was going to need stitches. No joke, the gash was at least to bone level, although it
                was filled with blood so you couldn't see it. <br />
                <br />
                Luckily, it wasn't bleeding profusely, but we still needed to go to the hospital and fast, as a boy has a massive gash in his leg literally covered with toilet paper. The car ride there was fairly interesting, as at that
                point the boy stopped worrying about it, in which he wasn't crying but holding tears back. It hurt, but not as bad now. This I'm sure will be the first time you'll hear about staples being used instead of stitches, but that
                doesn't matter. The point is the boy was right, he would need siches after all. However, because the bone was so close to the skin anyway, the doctor decided that the<br />
                boy would be better off having a few staples as a replacement for stitches.<br />
                <br />
                In case if you were wondering, that boy was me, PRIZ, the best memer there is out there, only because how do you need stiches from hitting the toilet? The toilet no joke took it like a boss, nothing happened to it
                whatsoever, which is funny, because now I have a scar on my leg reminding me to not play in the bathroom.<br />
                <br />
                Believe me, you could not make this shit up even if you tried, this is 100% true, and thanks for being entertained at my stupidity. Please, laugh, I genuinely enjoy watching other's reactions at my follies of the past.<br />

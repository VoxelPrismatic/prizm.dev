#] Pretty neat, eh?

All of these features, with one dev and only a year of development. \
The best bit is, this bot has a better uptime than Dyno, and more personality \
than whatever the fuck YAGPDB is trying to do... I'm serious, the boomer devs \
over at YAGPDB stole my idea of having relatable/funny statuses.

#] Notice

Development on PRIZM is now slow because of my development on my PRIZMATIC \
module, which is a replacement for `discord.py`. I will always fix bugs whenever \
I see them, as I want to make sure PRIZM is stable.

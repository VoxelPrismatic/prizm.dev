#] Our Reason
#"# Here at Apple, we are struggling to find new revolutionary ideas. So our new idea is awesome; \
at first, it seems counter intuitive, and then is. We've made our new products............. worse. \
We couldn't think of any new ideas, and we are struggling to find another person like Steve Jobs. #"#

#] Our Moto
In our pursuit of finding the best way to make our products worse, we've developed a wonderful moto, \
"Now figure that shit out."

#] MacBook
Different charging port for every laptop, so you can't borrow a friend's when you forget yours. 
If you ask your friend, your friend will say, "Oh, I have the new MacBook charger, but not the new, new one," \
or some bullshit like that, "Hey, I think Rachael over there has it," But Rachael has second generation. 

And then you realized that we changed the charging port half-way through this list. 
We changed the port on this device so many times to screw you over, and because it is super important that this \
port has 13 pins instead of 7, or some shit like that. You may ask yourself, "Why?".... It’s because FUCK YOU, that’s why.

#2020 Update#
The MacBook is so similar to the Air model, why innovate why we can just remove the product altogether?
*~rip macbook~*

#] 'MacBook' Air
Just air, literally. The name makes sense, perfect sense. So you are just wasting over $500 to get air. There is no charging port. \
Oh, and you can not buy it from the store, it has to be shipped to you for over $9000. Look inside the box, and you will find Apple \
branded air, but don’t open up too quickly, because it won’t last nearly is long.

#] iPod
Can't even play music. You know, the thing that changed music, well note you can only listen to 4'33"! Also, it is now a useless \
1 bit flash drive, the size of a rock. Now figure that shit out. Oh wait, you can’t, because we think you are too stupid \
to do anything other than make one last reath before you get consumed in the $1000 price tag that we put on this garbage.

#] iPod 'Nano'
Absolutely massive, really defeats the name and purpose of this product. And why not add a minuscule screen, that has 4 pixels. \
One that indicates the power status, one that indicates if it is looping, one that indicates if it is shuffling, and the last one \
indicates the charging status. Just 4 tiny LEDs not even far-sighted people can see.

#] iMac '4k'
By now, you would think that this product will not have a 4K display, but you're wrong. Instead, there are 4 kilobytes of RAM, \
4 kilobytes of cache, and only 4 kilobytes of usable storage. The best part is, it runs Minecraft 4K \
(4 kilobyte edition [Horrible graphics, horrible game play, no survival mode, no hot bar, no good, just random blocks here and there])

#] iPhone
We've removed the most useless feature of the phone, the phone. Not only have removed a redundant feature, but we've also fixed \
all the bugs and problems that the phone app was responsible for! The battery indicator now actually "works", in which it doesn't, \
so your device \ will die at about 30%. Also it is still compatible with the MacBook, unless we change the charging port, again.
Oh, and we absolutely fucking will.

#] iOS
We at apple have created our own version of multitasking. You know that blue phone, that Samsung Galaxy S3? Yeah, that one. \
The latest firmware it supports is Android KitKat 4.4.2, which is about 3 years old. And that small little device, can somehow do \
true multitasking, while our newest iPads, (not iPad pro) can't even do it. Yup, older androids are more powerful than our newest \
iPads.

#] iPadOS
So, we've released a version of iOS called iPadOS, which we claim can do actual multitasking, in which you can have up to 2 apps \
open at the same time. Oh what bullshit we love saying. The Samsung Note Edge can handle 5 apps hovering, and 2 apps side-by-side \
#SIMULTANIOUSLY!# Unfortunately, we do not have the processing power of a 5, 6 year old phone in our latest "pro" devices. Dang.
Yes, that 7 simultanious app combo uses a lot of energy and RAM, all of which we have in the iPad Pro, but we are just too damn \
lazy to have 2 versions of iOS going out to different devices rather than trying to stick with the same 1 iOS many devices thing \
we've been doing since the beginning.

#] Mac 'Pro'
HAH! Who needs a car when you can buy this and $400 wheels? I know I sure don't...
Tip Pro™ v1: Use the stand as your seat.
Tip Pro™ v2: Use the monitor as your license plate.
*totes legit tips btw, use em*

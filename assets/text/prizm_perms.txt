###] KICK\_MEMBERS
Self explanitory. Only used with the `;]kick` command. User permissions are checked beforehand.

###] BAN\_MEMBERS
Self explanitory. Only used with the `;]ban` command. User permissions are checked beforehand.

###] MANAGE\_CHANNELS
This bot does not manage any channels unless using the `;]audit` command.
That command is an in-chat editor for things, allowing you to edit stuff like \
the NSFW status on iOS. Only specified user moderators are allowed to use `;]audit`.

###] MANAGE\_GUILD
This bot does not manage the guild unless using the `;]audit` command.
That command is an in-chat editor for things, allowing you to edit stuff like \
the NSFW status on iOS. Only specified user moderators are allowed to use `;]audit`.

###] ADD\_REACTIONS
For the interface stuff, like `;]audit`, `;]manage`, etc. Keep this enabled for PRIZM to function properly.

###] VIEW\_AUDIT\_LOG
For logging purposes. Logging isn't enabled by default.

###] VIEW\_CHANNEL
Fairly obvious now isn't it. This should be kept enabled so PRIZM can see messages as they come.

###] SEND\_MESSAGES
Self explanitory. PRIZM can't do much of anything without it.

###] MANAGE\_MESSAGES
For clearing messages out and stuff. User permissions are checked beforehand.

###] EMBED\_LINKS
For embeds like every other bot. Used for much of everything.

###] ATTACH\_FILES
For extra logging info or other commands. Leave this enabled.

###] READ\_MESSAGE\_HISTORY
Self explanitory. Keep this enabled so PRIZM can manage messages after occasional restarts.

###] USE\_EXTERNAL\_EMOJIS
I have a custom emoji server. Please allow this otherwise the bot may not function properly.

###] CONNECT
Connect to VC. Used only for music.

###] SPEAK
Play music. The music command is not as developed as dedicated music bots.

###] CHANGE\_NICKNAME
Not necessary, I don't know why I added it but I'm too lazy to change it.

###] MANAGE\_NICKNAMES
So you can manage nicknames much more easily using the `;]nick` command. User permissions are checked beforehand.

###] MANAGE\_ROLES
This bot does not manage roles unless using the `;]audit` command.
That command is an in-chat editor for things, allowing you to edit stuff like \
the NSFW status on iOS. Only specified user moderators are allowed to use `;]audit`.

#] Music
You see, I'm not an audiophile, however, there is one thing that I cannot stand \
when listening to music: listening to an ad every 3 songs. This is infuriating. \
Why listen to ads when you can just download your music? We have #512GB# phones, \
I think we have enough storage to handle it.

#] My tech
I'm still stuck in 2012. Let me tell you why.

##] Phone
This is my ?[Samsung Replenish]<Model: SPH-M580>:

You may be asking why I still use it in 2020+... And the answer is: why not, \
bro$+..;ther? I can still watch YouTube, and access Twitter. I honestly can't \
remember the last time I listened to an ad on this thing. With YouTube, you get \
an ad before the video once every 10 videos or so, with no midrolls ever [the \
thing just can't support it anyway]. It also boasts a wopping #INFINITE# amount \
of storage, given you have a large enough micro sd card to put in it. Granted, \
it's very slow [with only 300mb of RAM] and has a shitty cammera, and ?[cannot \
tolerate water whatsoever]<No really, you drop it in snow and then the charging \
circuit is killed>

##] Laptop
This is my HP Probook 6570b:

Let's compare it with HP's best offering: The HP ZBook 15U
design. Now, we have the following spekths on the HP ZBook 15U, a laptop so \
embarrassed by it's design it literally doesn't say it's model number anywhere.

| Spekths | HP ZBook 15U [2018?] | HP Probook 6570b [2012] |
| RAM | 32gb DDR4 Sodimm | 16gb DDR3 Sodimm |
| Storage | 500gb HDD | 500gb HDD |
| USB | 2x USB 3 [thats it] | 3x USB 2 + 2x USB 3 |
| CPU | i7 6600U @2.60GHZ [Turbo @3.40GHz]<br>*Not replaceable<br>*Regularly \
reaches over 80c | i5-3210M @2.50GHz [Turbo @3.10GHz]<br>Is replaceable<br>\
*Properly cooled [never over 60c] |
| Fan | Wait it has one? | Breezy |
| Percieved speed | None at all | I can't believe this thing is from 2011 |

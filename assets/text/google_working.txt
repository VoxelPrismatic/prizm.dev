#] So what still works?
*for android 2.3.6 on my SPH-M580 from 2011
**what I use

| Website/App | Pros | Cons |
| YouTube | Little to no ads! And, no ad-breaks whatsoever | Only in the browser, and no video resume |
| Google Authenticator | Dark theme, and light on storage | None at all |
| Reddit | None | Uses 'Diode', which can't view Multireddits |
| Email | Dark theme | None |
| Google itself | None | None |
| Maps | None | None |
| Hotspot | None | None |
| Google Play Store | None | Eats up all of your storage, literally |
| Phone/Text/VoiceMail | None | VoiceMail is non-visual |

#] So what doesn't work anymore?

> The YouTube app
> News/Weather
> Most websites that use SSL/TLS will not work, like GitHub Pages
> > BUT! Opera Mini solves that issue just fine
> The Market that it comes with
> Discord, unfortunately.

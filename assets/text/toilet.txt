#] The toilet
Once upon a time, a boy played hide and go seek with his friends. Because all of his \
friends were boys, they all agreed that the bathroom was a valid place to go hide. Of \
course, only an idiot would actually hide in the bathroom, so luckily the boy wasn't. \
Instead, he hid behind the bathroom in the forest or around there. Anyway, as the game \
went on, it became much more intense, as everybody was trying to find everybody else. \
Unfortunately, the boy had such great luck to have been found, but he was the first \
one to check the bathroom.

Upon entering the establishment, the boy realized that the stalls were made of brick, \
and could be short enough to sit on top of. All the others gathered round to eventually \
conclude that it would be cool to sit up there, but overall a stupid idea. This boy \
thought otherwise, so he proceeded to hop on the toilet, and climb on top of the brick \
stall. As expected, the stall didn't topple over. Unamazed, the others left as it would \
be suspicious seing like 5 people in the bathroom walking around while one is on top of \
the stall. 

Soon, lunch was called, so the boy hopped down from the stall trying to land on the \
toilet seat as an intermediate step. A pretty easy "challenge", wouldn't you say? Well, \
against all logic and common sense, the boy missed the top of the toilet and instead \
his lower leg hit the edge of the toilet pretty hard. Well, just a little bruise, maybe \
a big one at most, right? Surely the toilet couldn't have done too much damage to him... \
RIGHT? *#NOPE!#* Somehow, the smooth toilet edge created a massive gash in the \
middle of the boy's leg, and right away he knew that he was going to need stitches. No joke, the \
gash was at least to bone level, although it was filled with blood so you couldn't see \
it. 

Luckily, it wasn't bleeding profusely, but we still needed to go to the hospital and \
fast, as a boy has a massive gash in his leg literally covered with toilet paper. The \
car ride there was fairly interesting, as at that point the boy stopped worrying about \
it, in which he wasn't crying but holding tears back. It hurt, but not as bad now. This \
I'm sure will be the first time you'll hear about staples being used instead of stitches, \
but that doesn't matter. The point is the boy was right, he would need siches after all. \
However, because the bone was so close to the skin anyway, the doctor decided that the
boy would be better off having a few staples as a replacement for stitches.

In case if you were wondering, that boy was me, PRIZ, the best memer there is out there, \
only because how do you need stiches from hitting the toilet? The toilet \
no joke took it like a boss, nothing happened to it whatsoever, which is funny, \
because now I have a scar on my leg reminding me to not play in the bathroom.

Believe me, you could not make this shit up even if you tried, this is 100% true, \
and thanks for being entertained at my stupidity. Please, laugh, I genuinely \
enjoy watching other's reactions at my follies of the past.

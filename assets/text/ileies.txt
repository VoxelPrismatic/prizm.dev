#] Truly the best programmer
Ileies#7527 is of the best programmers I've ever seen. The only man to come in to my DMs, \
and shit on my passion projects because I use Python rather than W3.

I didn't tell him that I would screenshot the entire conversation, but honestly that's a good thing. \
How else could we experience the finest programmer in the world talking down to a 16 y/o who has a passion.

#] Truly the best programmer
Ileies#7527 is of the best programmers I've ever seen. The only man to come in to my DMs, \
and shit on my passion projects because I use Python rather than W3.

I didn't tell him that I would screenshot the entire conversation, but honestly that's a good thing. \
How else could we experience the finest programmer in the world talking down to a 16 y/o who has a passion.

Yes I know that I may seem toxic myself, but you have to understand that he jumped in to shit on me \
because I use python rather than JS, PHP, or C.

I small history about ileies:
On sep-9-2020, he joined the C418 server. He saw that I made a music player and asked if i was \
indeed a programmer. I said yes, and he started shitting on me for using python. He claims to \
have made an app similar to discord, but the two links he gave me resulted in a nonfunctional and \
quite bland page, and some encryptor which nobody has access to unless they have the link.

Fun fact: You also have to download Node.JS on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Just so happens \
you have an interpreter in your browser, but that's all you get.

Disclaimer: The edited message saying that I was a mainstream programmer was edited to include \
that bit. I knew they weren't serious about it.

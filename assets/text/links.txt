#] PRIZMATIC
*Kinda stalled because discord doesn't ever update their documentation and its a pain to work with

Hey! I'm making an API wrapper for Discord, Reddit, and Riot.IM! If you use any \
of these services, well you should also know the bot that I made. Soon, I will \
transition my bot to use this module, so I don't have to use this `discord.py` \
garbage that I'm currently using...

#] PRIZ PLAYER ;]
PRIZ PLAYER is a next gen player that has a terminal aesthetic and works amazingly well. Built and designed for *LINUX* but \
may or may not run on Windows / Mac, I haven't tested those yet. Should work on mac much better than windows though, due to \
the similar architecture and interaction level.

#] WHO AM I?

I am a human [duh] that loves to code really much of anything. I made a discord \
bot [PRIZM] in about a month, while teaching myself #Python# in about the same \
time. I've actually been working on PRIZM for quite a while now, and am working on \
a replacement for the dreaded `discord.py` that almost everybody I know despises.

I love making music and creating neat code things just because I find it relaxing. \
My favorite genre is ambient in case you wanted to know that.

I'm okay at graphic design, or I'm great at it if you like my logo at the top of \
the page ;]

I'm also kind of an idiot, you can see how over [here]</prizm.dev/toilet> 

#Enough about me, how about you?# /s

I *was* also worthy of being one of the best programmers in the world. \
Please go check out [how that went]</prizm.dev/ileies>.

#] WHAT LANGUAGES DO I USE/KNOW?

I am currently learning #Java#, with literally the worst teacher ever. I also know \
a bit of #JS#, and ofc I use Python. Additionally, I use #TI-BASIC#, where I made RPN \
for the TI-84+CE. I can learn any language very quickly, however. I also made my \
version of #MarkDown# in JS, so I can make pretty neat looking sites such as the one \
you are seeing here. I can learn any language pretty quickly, however, mainly \
because I can mentally switch between syntax and functions efficiently and with \
great ease.

I also know a small bit about #SQLite#, #JSON#, #HTML#, and #CSS/LESS#. With the \
power of CSS/LESS and HTML, I have successfully made a website UI that nobody likes \
due to flashy colors, although those are the colors I have chosen for my logo and \
people seem to like that.

I've tried out a bit of #Swift#, but stopped that because Swift is based on Obj-C, \
which is by Apple, which makes honestly the worst documentation for anything.

#TL;DR:# I've tried/am using `Java`, `Python`, `TI-BASIC`, `JS`, `MarkDown`, `SQLite`, \
`JSON`, `HTML`, `LESS/CSS`, and `Swift`

Not all is good with learning so many languages, the issues can be found [here]</prizm.dev/wat>

###] MarkDown

All of these pages use my own flavor of MarkDown in some way. You can +[try it out]</prizm.dev/md> \
yourself, and even add it to your own website as well!

#] MY COMEDY

I'm an idiot, you can see how over [here]</prizm.dev/toilet> 

Also on my Twitter, [\[links below\]]<#STALKME>, I make fake ads that at first appear \
legit at first, but what can I say?

Lastly, mate, I've made many apple things but worse, over [here]</prizm.dev/apple>
Don't worry, I also have some issues with google, over [here]</prizm.dev/google>

#] Linux Sucks 2020
[View the video]<https://youtu.be/cZN5n6C9gM4>

I have some issues with this, so I'll be the "Fedora" guy in the front seat.

##] Linux is buggy
Yes, it is. I mean, all OSs first released are buggy, look at how Windows 10 \
deleted thousands of important documents due to a bug while updating. Linux is \
no different. That's why people contribute to it, to improve and to remove bugs.

##] Linux on servers
Thanks for mentioning, I would've gone off on that one.

##] Linux on mobile
Android is fairly open source to my knowledge. Also mobile OSs don't resemble \
desktop OSs. Look at iOS and macOS or Windows Phone and Windows and XBOX. \
Different platforms need different UIs, that's just how it is.

##] Market share
Well no duh. It's a viscous circle. Less people search for it because less \
people find a reason to use it, so less people install it, and again.

##] Backwards compatibility
Virtual machine? Honestly I don't use old software so I can't say anything.

##] AppImage
I fully agree. I tried installing an AppImage program, hell.

##] Linux people are dumb
Nah mate. Linux people are *stubborn*, not dumb.

##] Committees
You lost me, genuinely. A couple of examples could've helped.

##] Mega-Corps
Absolutely. Fork it. If an app doesn't work for one company, fork the app \
and make a new version.
Now what competitors do you speak of? Linux is funded by many companies, \
so all of them want the best for Linux. Is one trying to buy Linux over another? \
I don't understand.

##] The presentation on a Mac
Lol.
About the developer conferences: makes a bit more sense. If you are adding \
a feature that currently doesn't exist in your OS or are editing that feature \
it's best not to use it in case of bugs.
The only reason why I could think that most Linux devs use Macs to program is \
because Linux and Mac are very similar in the way you interact with them in the \
command line.

##] We kick out people with different opinions
That is a reason why we are dumb, yes.

##] Thanks
I want to thank Bryan Lunduke for being brave enough to talk about this. I \
cannot wait for Linux Sucks 2021 so I can make another one of these. This was \
fun.

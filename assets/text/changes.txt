> Added twitter integration
  > You can have up to 20 tweeters to listen to per server.
  > The more people using this integration, the slower it will be to update. Accurate up to 15s
> Starboard updates
  > If you send a message containing only a link to an image such that discord will embed the \
image and hide the link, that image will show up as an attachment in the starboard.

###] MODERATION
The `;]enable` and `;]disable` commands now support turning off groups of commands rather than one command at a time
###] PAYING RESPECTS
Pressing `F` has never been cleaner
also you can take back your respects now, but if you do then...
###] BUGS
Fixed a bug where some commands couldn't be en/disabled
For those who want to know why: I was not checking the bot commands but instead the files in which the commands were located. Some files have multiple commands, that's why it didn't work.

###] STARBOARD
Yes, PRIZM now has a starboard. Enjoy.
*How do you set it up?*
Use the `;]manage` command, and you can set up other things in there too
###] MANAGEMENT
The starboard management now stays open until a timeout or you exit. Pretty easy.

###] MODERATION
The `;]enable` and `;]disable` commands now support turning off groups of commands rather than one command at a time
###] PAYING RESPECTS
Pressing `F` has never been cleaner
also you can take back your respects now, but if you do then...
###] BUGS
Fixed a bug where some commands couldn't be en/disabled
For those who want to know why: I was not checking the bot commands but instead the files in which the commands were located. Some files have multiple commands, that's why it didn't work.

###] STARBOARD
Yes, PRIZM now has a starboard. Enjoy.
*How do you set it up?*
Use the `;]manage` command, and you can set up other things in there too
###] MANAGEMENT
The starboard management now stays open until a timeout or you exit. Pretty easy.

- - You can use ranges like 0-16
- - You can be relative like ~1
- - You can use relative ranges like ~9-26
*If no params are passed, the image is sent
*If only coordinates are passed, the color at that coordinate is sent along with the image
*ALL relative points are relative to the previously drawn point IN THE SAME MESSAGE
*^ Any starting relative points will be relative to 0, 0

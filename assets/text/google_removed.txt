#] A list of things that Google has killed
*that I actually used/am using, on android mostly

###] 1. AMOLED Dark theme
"Wait! That exists in Android 8.0+!"
But what you don't know is that my phone from 2011 has it too. Not as an option, \
but literally as the only theme it has. There is no light mode, only dark. Google \
actually removed dark mode in Android 5.0 [Lollipop]

In Google HQ: "Only plebians with eyes need dark mode, so they don't burn their \
eyes out"

###] 2. File Transfer
"Wait, you can share over bluetooth!"
But did you know that back in 2011, with Android 2.3 [Gingerbread], you can view \
the entire contents of the SD card... over bluetooth... with any trusted device. \
No joke, it's like the SD card is in the computer, except it's in read-only. You \
can still transfer stuff to it over bluetooth, just not into the directory you \
want.

Instead, in Android 4.4 [KitKat] at least, you can only send files to it, and it \
has this weird bluetooth wifi thing that doesn't even work.

###] 3. UnZipping files locally
"Wait you can do that!"
Not in Android 4.4 [KitKat] you can't. In Android 2.3 [Gingerbread], you can.

#] Google's tag-line
"Features", the one thing that is *meant* to be removed.

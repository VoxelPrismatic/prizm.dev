#] A list of things that Google has killed
*that I actually used/am using, on android mostly

###] AMOLED Dark theme
*"Wait! That exists in Android 8.0+!"*

But what you don't know is that my phone from 2011 has it too. Not as an option, \
but literally as the only theme it has. There is no light mode, only dark. Google \
actually removed dark mode in Android 5.0 [Lollipop]

In Google HQ: "Only plebians with eyes need dark mode, so they don't burn their \
eyes out"

###] Bluetooth File Transfer
*"Wait, you can share over bluetooth!"*

But did you know that back in 2011, with Android 2.3 [Gingerbread], you can view \
the entire contents of the SD card... over bluetooth... with any trusted device. \
No joke, it's like the SD card is in the computer, except it's really slow. With \
Linux, all you have to do is install `obexftp` and now you can even write to it \
remotely!

Instead, in Android 4.4 [KitKat] at least, you can only send files to it via \
bluetooth sharing, and it has this weird bluetooth wifi thing that doesn't even work.

###] UnZipping files locally
*"Wait you can do that!"*

Not in Android 4.4 [KitKat] you can't. In Android 2.3 [Gingerbread], you can. \
Idk why this feature was removed, it literally makes no sense.

###] The MENU button
*"Who needs the menu button? It's in settings anyway"*

Well sometimes I don't want to reach the top of the screen to click 3 dots, \
and sometimes they aren't even there!

###] The SEARCH button
*"Bruh you have eyes"*

Bruh Android 2.3 has spotlight search, like in iOS. And when supported, \
I can just type using a physical keyboard and it will automatically search through \
a list! Like in the music app, just start typing, and it will filter down the items. \
Works in managing apps and even more!

#] Google's tag-line
"Features", the one thing that is #*meant*# to be removed.

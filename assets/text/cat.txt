#] My Cat
My cat's name is Cluster, named such because he is a clusterfuck of destruction. His nickname is \
"Miersky kot", russian for a "cat that brings pain"

#] Intelligence

My cat is *#not#* the smartest, let me give you an example:
One day, Cluster finds a mouse. The mouse, understandably, hides behind the chest freezer, and \
Cluster cannot reach. So, Cluster jumps to one side of the freezer. Now, the mouse feels threatened \
again, so found another hiding spot and ran to it. So, Cluster jumps to the *other* side of the freezer...
I help him out by uncovering the mouse, and cluster runs right over. Pretty good, right? Just you wait.
The mouse runs to about 5 feet away from the furnace room, and takes a break. So Cluster runs right to \
it. >!Cluster proceeds to sit still staring at the mouse for up to 5 seconds. The mouse then moves and \
then Cluster starts chasing right away!<

I'm sure that every mouse died of exhaustion before Cluster jumped on it, which is a very sad thought.
